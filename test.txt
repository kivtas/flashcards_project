Dialectical materialism
Dialectical materialism is a materialist theory based upon the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels that has found widespread applications in a variety of philosophical disciplines ranging from
philosophy of history to philosophy of science.
[1][2] As a materialist philosophy, Marxist dialectics
emphasizes the importance of real-world conditions and the presence of functional contradictions within
and among social relations, which derive from, but are not limited to, the contradictions that occur in
social class, labour economics, and socioeconomic interactions.[3] Within Marxism, a contradiction is a
relationship in which two forces oppose each other, leading to mutual development.[4]: 256
In contrast with the idealist perspective of Hegelian dialectics, the materialist perspective of Marxist
dialectics emphasizes that contradictions in material phenomena could be resolved with dialectical
analysis, from which is synthesized the solution that resolves the contradiction, whilst retaining the
essence of the phenomena. Marx proposed that the most effective solution to the problems caused by
contradiction was to address the contradiction and then rearrange the systems of social organization that
are the root of the problem.[5]
Dialectical materialism recognises the evolution of the natural world, and thus the emergence of new
qualities of being human and of human existence. Engels used the metaphysical insight that the higher
level of human existence emerges from and is rooted in the lower level of human existence. He believed
that the higher level of being is a new order with irreducible laws, and that evolution is governed by laws
of development, which reflect the basic properties of matter in motion.
[6][7]
In the 20th century, the revolutionary Marxist Vladimir Lenin proposed his own interpretation of Marxist
dialectics, which took an essential place among the views and doctrines of Leninism and was later
propagated by such his followers as Leon Trotsky. Since the 1930s, a Marxist-Leninist reading of
dialectical materialism introduced by such leaders of communist states as Joseph Stalin (Stalinist Soviet
Union) and Mao Zedong (Maoist China) set forth the official formulations on dialectical materialism and
historical materialism, which were taught in state systems of education. In the West, different approaches
towards Marxist dialectics were proposed by such authors of Western Marxism as György Lukács and
Slavoj Žižek.
The term
The term dialectical materialism was coined in 1887 by Joseph Dietzgen, a socialist who corresponded
with Marx, during and after the failed 1848 German Revolution.
[8][9] Casual mention of the term
"dialectical materialism" is also found in the biography Frederick Engels, by philosopher Karl
Kautsky,
[10] written in 1899. Marx himself had talked about the "materialist conception of history", which
was later referred to as "historical materialism" by Engels. Engels "substantially developed materialist
dialectics" in his incomplete 1883 work Dialectics of Nature.
[11] Georgi Plekhanov, the father of Russian
Marxism, first used the term "dialectical materialism" in 1891 in his writings on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich
Hegel and Marx.[12] Stalin further delineated and defined dialectical and historical materialism as the
world outlook of Marxism–Leninism, and as a method to study society and its history.
[13]
Historical background
Marx and Engels each began their adulthood as Young Hegelians, one of several groups of intellectuals
inspired by the philosopher Hegel.[14][15] Marx's doctoral thesis, The Difference Between the
Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature, was concerned with the atomism of Epicurus and
Democritus, which is considered the foundation of materialist philosophy. Marx was also familiar with
Lucretius's theory of clinamen.
Marx and Engels both concluded that Hegelian philosophy, at least as interpreted by their former
colleagues, was too abstract and was being misapplied in attempts to explain the social injustice in
recently industrializing countries such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, which was a
growing concern in the early 1840s, as exemplified by Dickensian inequity.
[15]
In contrast to the conventional Hegelian dialectic of the day, which emphasized the idealist observation
that human experience is dependent on the mind's perceptions, Marx developed Marxist dialectics, which
emphasized the materialist view that the world of the concrete shapes socioeconomic interactions and that
those in turn determine sociopolitical reality.
[14]
Whereas some Hegelians blamed religious alienation (estrangement from the traditional comforts of
religion) for societal ills, Marx and Engels concluded that alienation from economic and political
autonomy, coupled with exploitation and poverty, was the real culprit.[15]
In keeping with dialectical ideas, Marx and Engels thus created an alternative theory, not only of why the
world is the way it is but also of which actions people should take to make it the way it ought to be. In
Theses on Feuerbach (1845), Marx wrote a famous quote, "The philosophers have only interpreted the
world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it."[14] Dialectical materialism is thus closely
related to Marx's and Engels's historical materialism (and has sometimes been viewed as synonymous
with it). Marx rejected Fichte's language of "thesis, antithesis, synthesis".[16]
Dialectical materialism is an aspect of the broader subject of materialism, which asserts the primacy of
the material world: in short, matter precedes thought. Materialism is a realist philosophy of science,
[17]
which holds that the world is material; that all phenomena in the universe consist of "matter in motion,"
wherein all things are interdependent and interconnected and develop according to natural law; that the
world exists outside consciousness and independently of people's perception of it; that thought is a
reflection of the material world in the brain, and that the world is in principle knowable.
Marx criticized classical materialism as another idealist philosophy—idealist because of its transhistorical
understanding of material contexts. The Young Hegelian Ludwig Feuerbach had rejected Hegel's
idealistic philosophy and advocated materialism.[18] Despite being strongly influenced by Feuerbach,[18]
Marx rejected Feuerbach's version of materialism (anthropological materialism) as inconsistent.[19] The
writings of Engels, especially Anti-Dühring (1878) and Dialectics of Nature (1875–82), were the source
of the main doctrines of dialectical materialism.[16]
Classical Marxism
Marx's dialectics
The concept of dialectical materialism emerges from statements by Marx in the second edition postface to
his magnum opus, Das Kapital. There Marx says he intends to use Hegelian dialectics but in revised
form. He defends Hegel against those who view him as a "dead dog" and then says, "I openly avowed
myself as the pupil of that mighty thinker Hegel".[20] Marx credits Hegel with "being the first to present
[dialectic's] form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner". But he then criticizes Hegel for
turning dialectics upside down: "With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again,
if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.".[21][22]
Marx's criticism of Hegel asserts that Hegel's dialectics go astray by dealing with ideas, with the human
mind. Hegel's dialectic, Marx says, inappropriately concerns "the process of the human brain"; it focuses
on ideas. Hegel's thought is in fact sometimes called dialectical idealism, and Hegel himself is counted
among a number of other philosophers known as the German idealists. Marx, on the contrary, believed
that dialectics should deal not with the mental world of ideas but with "the material world", the world of
production and other economic activity.
[21] For Marx, a contradiction can be solved by a desperate
struggle to change the social world. This was a very important transformation because it allowed him to
move dialectics out of the contextual subject of philosophy and into the study of social relations based on
the material world.[23]
For Marx, human history cannot be fitted into any neat a priori schema. He explicitly rejects the idea of
Hegel's followers that history can be understood as "a person apart, a metaphysical subject of which real
human individuals are but the bearers".[24] To interpret history as though previous social formations have
somehow been aiming themselves toward the present state of affairs is "to misunderstand the historical
movement by which the successive generations transformed the results acquired by the generations that
preceded them".[25] Marx's rejection of this sort of teleology was one reason for his enthusiastic (though
not entirely uncritical) reception of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.
[26]
For Marx, dialectics is not a formula for generating predetermined outcomes but is a method for the
empirical study of social processes in terms of interrelations, development, and transformation. In his
introduction to the Penguin edition of Marx's Capital, Ernest Mandel writes, "When the dialectical
method is applied to the study of economic problems, economic phenomena are not viewed separately
from each other, by bits and pieces, but in their inner connection as an integrated totality, structured
around, and by, a basic predominant mode of production."[27]
Marx's own writings are almost exclusively concerned with understanding human history in terms of
systemic processes, based on modes of production (broadly speaking, the ways in which societies are
organized to employ their technological powers to interact with their material surroundings). This is
called historical materialism. More narrowly, within the framework of this general theory of history, most
of Marx's writing is devoted to an analysis of the specific structure and development of the capitalist
economy.
For his part, Engels applies a "dialectical" approach to the natural world in general, arguing that
contemporary science is increasingly recognizing the necessity of viewing natural processes in terms of
interconnectedness, development, and transformation. Some scholars have doubted that Engels'
"dialectics of nature" is a legitimate extension of Marx's approach to social processes.[28][29][30][31] Other
scholars have argued that despite Marx's insistence that humans are natural beings in an evolving, mutual
relationship with the rest of nature, Marx's own writings pay inadequate attention to the ways in which
human agency is constrained by such factors as biology, geography, and ecology.
[32][33]
Engels's dialectics
Engels postulated three laws of dialectics from his reading of Hegel's Science of Logic.
[34] Engels
elucidated these laws as the materialist dialectic in his work Dialectics of Nature:
1. The law of the unity and conflict of opposites
2. The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes
3. The law of the negation of the negation
The first law, which originates with the ancient Ionian philosopher Heraclitus,
[35] can be clarified through
the following examples:
For example, in biological evolution the formation of new forms of life occurs precisely
through the unity and struggle of opposites in heredity and variability. In physical processes the
nature of light was explained precisely by means of the unity and struggle of opposites
appearing, for example, as corpuscular and wave properties; this, moreover, cleared the path for
a “drama of ideas” in physical science, whereby the opposition and synthesis of corpuscular
and wave theories characterized scientific progress. The most basic expression of the unity and
struggle of opposites in the world of commodity capitalism is that of use value and value; the
most highly developed oppositions in capitalism are the working class and the bourgeoisie,
—
The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979), Unity and Struggle of Opposites – Web page (htt
ps://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Unity+and+Struggle+of+Opposites)
The first law was seen by both Hegel and Vladimir Lenin as the central feature of a dialectical
understanding:
It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of oppositions in their unity,
or of the positive in the negative, that speculative thought consists. It is the most important
aspect of dialectic.
—
Hegel, Science of Logic, § 69, (p. 56 in the Miller edition)
The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence (one of
the "essentials", one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of
dialectics. That is precisely how Hegel, too, puts the matter.
—
Lenin's Collected Works: Volume 38, p. 359: On the question of dialectics.
The second law Hegel took from Ancient Greek philosophers, notably the paradox of the heap, and
explanation by Aristotle,
[36] and it is equated with what scientists call phase transitions. It may be traced
to the ancient Ionian philosophers, particularly Anaximenes[37] from whom Aristotle, Hegel, and Engels
inherited the concept. For all these authors, one of the main illustrations is the phase transitions of water.
There has also been an effort to apply this mechanism to social phenomena, whereby population increases
result in changes in social structure. The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative
changes can also be applied to the process of social change and class conflict.
[38]
The third law, "negation of the negation", originated with Hegel. Although Hegel coined the term
"negation of the negation", it gained its fame from Marx's using it in Capital. There Marx wrote this:
"The [death] knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated. The capitalist
mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private
property. This is the first negation of individual private property ... But capitalist production begets, with
the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It [this new negation] is the negation of
negation."[39]
Z. A. Jordan notes, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of
existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of
being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of
development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."[6]
Vladimir Lenin's contributions
After reading Hegel's Science of Logic in 1914, Lenin made some brief notes outlining three "elements"
of logic.[40] They are:
1. The determination of the concept out of itself [the thing itself must be considered in its
relations and in its development];
2. The contradictory nature of the thing itself (the other of itself), the contradictory forces and
tendencies in each phenomenon;
3. The union of analysis and synthesis.
Lenin develops these in a further series of notes, and appears to argue that "the transition of quantity into
quality and vice versa" is an example of the unity and opposition of opposites expressed tentatively as
"not only the unity of opposites but the transitions of every determination, quality, feature, side, property
into every other [into its opposite?]."
In his essay "On the Question of Dialectics", Lenin stated, "Development is the 'struggle' of opposites."
He stated, "The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary,
transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and
motion are absolute."[41]
In Materialism and Empiriocriticism (1908), Lenin explained dialectical materialism as three axes: (i) the
materialist inversion of Hegelian dialectics, (ii) the historicity of ethical principles ordered to class
struggle, and (iii) the convergence of "laws of evolution" in physics (Helmholtz), biology (Darwin), and
in political economy (Marx). Hence, Lenin was philosophically positioned between historicist Marxism
(Labriola) and determinist Marxism—a political position close to "social Darwinism" (Kautsky) .
Moreover, late-century discoveries in physics (x-rays, electrons), and the beginning of quantum
mechanics, philosophically challenged previous conceptions of matter and materialism, thus matter
seemed to be disappearing. Lenin disagreed:
'Matter disappears' means that the limit within which we have hitherto known matter
disappears, and that our knowledge is penetrating deeper; properties of matter are
disappearing that formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and primary, and which are now
revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain states of matter. For the sole
'property' of matter, with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up, is the
property of being an objective reality, of existing outside of the mind.
Lenin was developing the work of Engels, who said that "with each epoch-making discovery, even in the
sphere of natural science, materialism has to change its form".[42] One of Lenin's challenges was
distancing materialism, as a viable philosophical outlook, from the "vulgar materialism" expressed in the
statement "the brain secretes thought in the same way as the liver secretes bile" (attributed to 18th-
century physician Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis); "metaphysical materialism" (matter composed of
immutable particles); and 19th-century "mechanical materialism" (matter as random molecules
interacting per the laws of mechanics). The philosophic solution that Lenin (and Engels) proposed was
"dialectical materialism", wherein matter is defined as objective reality, theoretically consistent with
(new) developments occurring in the sciences.
Lenin reassessed Feuerbach's philosophy and concluded that it was in line with dialectical
materialism.[19]
Trotskyism
In 1926, Trotsky said in a speech:
It is the task of science and technology to make matter subject to man, together with space and
time, which are inseparable from matter. True, there are certain idealist books—not of a clerical
character, but philosophical ones—wherein you can read that time and space are categories of
our minds, that they result from the requirements of our thinking, and that nothing actually
corresponds to them in reality. But it is difficult to agree with this view. If any idealist
philosopher, instead of arriving in time to catch the 9 pm train, should turn up two minutes late,
he would see the tail of the departing train and would be convinced by his own eyes that time
and space are inseparable from material reality. The task is to diminish this space, to overcome
it, to economise time, to prolong human life, to register past time, to raise life to a higher level
and enrich it. This is the reason for the struggle with space and time, at the basis of which lies
the struggle to subject matter to man—matter, which constitutes the foundation not only of
everything that really exists, but also of all imagination ... Every science is an accumulation of
knowledge, based on experience relating to matter, to its properties; an accumulation of
generalised understanding of how to subject this matter to the interests and needs of man.[43]
In his book In Defence of Marxism, Leon Trotsky defended the dialectical method of scientific socialism
during the factional schisms within the American Trotskyist movement in the period 1939–40. Trotsky
viewed dialectics as an essential method of analysis to discern class nature of the Soviet Union.
Specifically, he described scientific socialism as "the conscious expression of the unconscious historical
process; namely, the instinctive and elemental drive of the proletariat to reconstruct society on communist
beginnings".[44]
Western Marxism
György Lukács's contributions
György Lukács, Minister of Culture in the brief Béla Kun government of the Hungarian Soviet Republic
(1919), published History and Class Consciousness (1923), in which he defined dialectical materialism
as the knowledge of society as a whole, knowledge which, in itself, was the class consciousness of the
proletariat. In the first chapter "What is Orthodox Marxism?", Lukács defined orthodoxy as fidelity to the
"Marxist method", not fidelity to "dogmas":
Orthodox Marxism, therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of
Marx's investigations. It is not the "belief" in this or that thesis, nor the exegesis of a "sacred"
book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction
that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed,
expanded, and deepened, only along the lines laid down by its founders. (§1)
In his later works and actions, Lukács became a leader of Democratic Marxism. He modified many of his
formulations of his 1923 works and went on to develop a Marxist ontology and played an active role in
democratic movements in Hungary in 1956 and the 1960s. He and his associates became sharply critical
of the formulation of dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union that was exported to those countries
under its control. In the 1960s, his associates became known as the Budapest School.
Lukács, in his philosophical criticism of Marxist revisionism, proposed an intellectual return to the
Marxist method. So did Louis Althusser, who later defined Marxism and psychoanalysis as "conflictual
sciences",[45] stating that political factions and revisionism are inherent to Marxist theory and political
praxis, because dialectical materialism is the philosophic product of class struggle:
For this reason, the task of orthodox Marxism, its victory over Revisionism and utopianism
can never mean the defeat, once and for all, of false tendencies. It is an ever-renewed
struggle against the insidious effects of bourgeois ideology on the thought of the proletariat.
Marxist orthodoxy is no guardian of traditions, it is the eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming
the relation between the tasks of the immediate present and the totality of the historical
process. (§5)
...the premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that
determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence that determines their
consciousness'.... Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can
existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity.
(§5)
Philosophically aligned with Marx is the criticism of the individualist, bourgeois philosophy of the
subject, which is founded upon the voluntary and conscious subject. Against said ideology is the primacy
of social relations. Existence—and thus the world—is the product of human activity, but this can be seen
only by accepting the primacy of social process on individual consciousness. This type of consciousness
is an effect of ideological mystification.
At the 5th Congress of the Communist International (July 1924), Grigory Zinoviev formally denounced
Lukács's heterodox definition of Orthodox Marxism as exclusively derived from fidelity to the "Marxist
method", and not to Communist party dogmas; and denounced the philosophical developments of the
German Marxist theorist Karl Korsch.
Slavoj Žižek's contributions
Slavoj Žižek proposed a new approach towards dialectical materialism as a "radical attempt to ground
subjectivity qua subjectivity into objectivity — not merely find the hidden 'objective reality' of
thought."[46] In his approach, he refused "to rule out the reference to Stalin's Dialectical and Historical
Materialism (1938) as a provocation," and his views have ambigious relations to the writings of Engels
and Stalin. "On the one hand, the birth of the Symbolic from the Real without the intermediary of a
socially shared space bears a strong resemblance to the emergence of universal human history from
matter in motion, histomat from diamat." On the other hand, Žižek believes that what makes his approach
essentially materialist is the denial of totality as opposite to Stalinist dialectics which rely on considering
history and society as totalities, unified wholes.[47]
For Zižek, 'the Other' (whether the Symbolic Order, or a political regime) never 'exists' as the
fully consistent whole that subjects imagine, as they shape their identities in relation to it.
This means that society, history and culture ultimately always depend for their illusory
'existence' as apparent wholes on the (unconscious) beliefs of subjects in them. This truth is
registered in a series of 'material' inconsistencies: the way ideologies have to posit enemies
'supposed to enjoy' our difficulties, and to rest at their heart on sublime Ideas like 'the
Nation', which no one can directly say what their content is. Thus, Žižek's 'dialectical
materialism' is ultimately the doctrine that 'the Other does not exist'.[47]
Marxism-Leninism
Joseph Stalin
In the 1930s, Stalin and his associates formulated a version of dialectical and historical materialism that
became the "official" Soviet interpretation of Marxism. It was codified in Stalin's work, Dialectical and
Historical Materialism (1938), and popularized in textbooks used for compulsory education within the
Soviet Union and throughout the Eastern Bloc.
Mao Zedong
In On Contradiction (1937), Mao Zedong outlined a version of dialectical materialism that subsumed two
of Engels's three principal laws of dialectics, "the transformation of quantity into quality" and "the
negation of the negation" as sub-laws (and not principal laws of their own) of the first law, "the unity and
interpenetration of opposites".
Ho Chi Minh
In his 1947 article New Life, Ho Chi Minh described the dialectical relationship between the old and the
new in building society, stating:[48]
Not everything old must be abandoned. We do not have to reinvent everything. What is old but
bad must be abandoned. What is old but troublesome must be corrected appropriately. What is
old but good must be further developed. What is new but good must be done.
As a heuristic in science and elsewhere
Historian of science Loren Graham has detailed at length the role played by dialectical materialism in the
Soviet Union in disciplines throughout the natural and social sciences. He has concluded that, despite the
Lysenko period in genetics and constraints on free inquiry imposed by political authorities, dialectical
materialism had a positive influence on the work of many Soviet scientists.[49]
Some evolutionary biologists, such as Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, have tried to employ
dialectical materialism in their approach. They view dialectics as playing a precautionary heuristic role in
their work. Lewontin's perspective offers the following idea:
Dialectical materialism is not, and never has been, a programmatic method for solving
particular physical problems. Rather, a dialectical analysis provides an overview and a set of
warning signs against particular forms of dogmatism and narrowness of thought. It tells us,
"Remember that history may leave an important trace. Remember that being and becoming
are dual aspects of nature. Remember that conditions change and that the conditions
necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself. Remember
to pay attention to real objects in time and space and not lose them in utterly idealized
abstractions. Remember that the qualitative effects of context and interaction may be lost
when phenomena are isolated". And above all else, "Remember that all the other caveats are
only reminders and warning signs whose application to different circumstances of the real
world is contingent."[50][51]
Gould shared similar views regarding a heuristic role for dialectical materialism. He wrote that:
...dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by Western scholars, not discarded
because some nations of the second world have constructed a cardboard version as an official
political doctrine.[52]
...when presented as guidelines for a philosophy of change, not as dogmatic precepts true by
fiat, the three classical laws of dialectics embody a holistic vision that views change as
interaction among components of complete systems and sees the components themselves not
as a priori entities, but as both products and inputs to the system. Thus, the law of
"interpenetrating opposites" records the inextricable interdependence of components: the
"transformation of quantity to quality" defends a systems-based view of change that
translates incremental inputs into alterations of state, and the "negation of negation"
describes the direction given to history because complex systems cannot revert exactly to
previous states.[53]
This heuristic was also applied to the theory of punctuated equilibrium proposed by Gould and Niles
Eldredge. They wrote that "history, as Hegel said, moves upward in a spiral of negations", and that
"punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and
the deployment of species in geological time."[54] They noted that "the law of transformation of quantity
into quality... holds that a new quality emerges in a leap as the slow accumulation of quantitative changes,
long resisted by a stable system, finally forces it rapidly from one state into another", a phenomenon
described in some disciplines as a paradigm shift. Apart from the commonly cited example of water
turning to steam with increased temperature, Gould and Eldredge noted another analogy in information
theory, "with its jargon of equilibrium, steady state, and homeostasis maintained by negative feedback",
and "extremely rapid transitions that occur with positive feedback".[55]
Lewontin, Gould, and Eldredge were thus more interested in dialectical materialism as a heuristic than a
dogmatic form of 'truth' or a statement of their politics. Nevertheless, they found a readiness for critics to
"seize upon" key statements[56] and portray punctuated equilibrium, and exercises associated with it, such
as public exhibitions, as a "Marxist plot".[57]
The Communist Party's official interpretation of Marxism, dialectical materialism, fit Alexander Oparin's
studies on the origins of life as 'a flow, an exchange, a dialectical unity'. This notion was re-enforced by
Oparin's association with Lysenko.
[58]
In 1972, China's Cultural Revolution slowed down and scientific research restarted. Astrophysicist and
cosmologist Fang Lizhi found an opportunity to read some recent astrophysics papers in western journals,
and soon wrote his first paper on cosmology, "A Cosmological Solution in Scalar-tensor Theory with
Mass and Blackbody Radiation", which was published on the journal Wu Li (Physics), V ol. 1, 163 (1972).
This was the first modern cosmological research paper in mainland China. Fang assembled a group of
young faculty members of USTC around him to conduct astrophysics research.[59]
Criticism
Philosopher Allen Wood argued that, in its form as an official Soviet philosophy, dialectical materialism
was doomed to be superficial because "creativity or critical thinking" was impossible in an authoritarian
environment. Nevertheless, he considered the basic aims and principles of dialectical materialism to be in
harmony with rational scientific thought.[16][60]
Economist and philosopher Ludwig von Mises wrote a critique of Marxist materialism which he
published as a part of his 1957 work Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic
Evolution. H. B. Acton described Marxism as "a philosophical farrago".[61] Max Eastman argued that
dialectical materialism lacks a psychological basis.[62]
Leszek Kołakowski criticized the laws of dialectics in Main Currents of Marxism, arguing that they
consist partly of truisms with no specific Marxist content, partly of philosophical dogmas, partly of
nonsense, and partly of statements that could be any of these things depending on how they are
interpreted.[63]
Of the term
Joseph Needham, an influential historian of science and a Christian who nonetheless was an adherent of
dialectical materialism, suggested that a more appropriate term might be "dialectical organicism".[64][65]
Marxist rejection
Anti-communist, formerly Marxist humanist, Leszek Kołakowski argued that dialectical materialism was
not truly Marxist.[60]
